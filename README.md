# uwe_class_locator
Helps student locate their lecture hall using just their hall number.

This project was developed with the aim of reducing the stress and time it takes to locate classes on campus mostly for new students and international studdents.
The way it functions is simple basically the user types in the class or hall where the lecture is located and the app directs them to the building or block and then gives an instruction on how to locate the class.
